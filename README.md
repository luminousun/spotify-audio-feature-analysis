# 🎧 Spotify Audio Feature Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
This project explores audio features of over 100,000 songs available on Spotify using Python and data science techniques. We'll analyze characteristics like energy, danceability, valence, tempo, and genre distributions to uncover patterns and musical trends.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify trends in music features like danceability, energy, and valence
- Analyze how audio features vary across genres and years
- Explore feature correlations (e.g., does higher energy = higher danceability?)
- Visualize popular vs. niche genres in terms of feature space

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [HuggingFace - Spotify Tracks Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/maharshipandya/spotify-tracks-dataset)
- Contains ~114,000 Spotify tracks with 18+ audio features and metadata

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Data handling: Jupyter Notebook
- Optional: Scikit-learn for clustering or PCA

## 📊 Sample Questions
- What genres have the most energetic songs?
- Are danceable songs usually also happy (valence)?
- How do track features change over release years?
- What are the feature similarities between pop and hip-hop?

## ✨ Example Insights (to be filled after analysis)
- Rock songs have the highest tempo on average
- Jazz and classical show low speechiness and high acousticness
- Positive correlation between danceability and energy

## 🤖 Optional Extensions
- Cluster songs based on feature similarity
- Create a recommendation engine using KNN
- Build a Streamlit dashboard
